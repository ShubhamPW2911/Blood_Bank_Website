# Blood_Bank_Website
Running a blood bank can be a difficult job but, it becomes effortless with an online application that handles all the details about blood donors, availability of various blood groups in each blood bank, and help them operate in a better way. We would use HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), Javascript, PHP, and MySQL for this purpose. Some of the features are:

Donor registration.
Inventory management for blood bank storage.
Donors who are suitable for donation with their contact information.
Transfering blood from one blood bank to another
